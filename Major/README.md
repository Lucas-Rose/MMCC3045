# Developer Notes

- Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get anywhere close to what my project plan had set out in delivering the full effect of allowing the audience to see the multiple stories of Major Tom come full circle.
- As it stands on submission only 2/6 of the possible variations of Major Tom's story were up to standard and working functionally to be able to submit without ruining the continuity of the experience.
- Unfortunately all 4 major work / final exam subjects for Game Dev Majors were due in a 3 day period which made it quite difficult to delegate between all subjects appropriately.
- I would have liked to use more music / sfx to convey interaction and further immersion in each of the actions the player had performed.
- Solving a more manageable JS file library had always been a huge pain either manually storing the THREE.js library in the files of the experience or from a CDN, apologies for repeat code and continual CDN calling which may cause lag on start/window url change for machines that have lower hardware than a standard pc.

- Nevertheless I hope you enjoyed the experience and my attempt at bringing a 3D edge to storytelling in the browser.
