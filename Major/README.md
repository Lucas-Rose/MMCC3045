# Developer Notes

- Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get anywhere close to what my project plan had set out in delivering the full effect of allowing the audience to see the multiple stories of Major Tom come full circle.
- As it stands on submission only 2/6 of the possible variations of Major Tom's story were up to standard and working functionally to be able to submit without ruining the continuity of the experience.
- Unfortunately all 4 major work / final exam subjects for Game Dev Majors were due in a 3 day period which made it quite difficult to delegate between all subjects appropriately.
- Nevertheless I hope you enjoyed the experience and my attempt at bringing a 3D edge to storytelling in the browser.
